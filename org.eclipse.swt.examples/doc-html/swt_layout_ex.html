<h2>SWT example - Layouts</h2>

<p>
This example is a simple demonstration of common SWT layouts. 
It consists of a tab folder where each tab in the folder allows the 
user to interact with a different SWT layout.
The user can insert widgets into a layout and set the values of the layout data
using a property sheet.  When the user has a suitable arrangement, the underlying
code can be generated by clicking on the <strong>Code</strong> button.
